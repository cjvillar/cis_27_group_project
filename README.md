# Compiler (cis_27_group_project)

## Project Overview
(This statement will change)
This project is focused on building a compiler from scratch. The goal is to create a functionaly limited compiler that can parse, analyze, and generate code from a high-level programming language to a lower-level language or machine code.

## Installation

To get started with the project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjvillar/cis_27_group_project/
cd cis_27_group_project
```

## Usage

1. Compile the project using your preferred build system or IDE.
2. Run the compiler on the source code file:

   ```bash
   ./compiler source_code_file
   ```

3. The compiler will generate the corresponding output code in the specified target language or machine code.
